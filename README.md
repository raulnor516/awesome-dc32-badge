## FAQ

- Q. My badge shows "No valid FAT partition found" when I try to load other GB/GBC ROMs?
  - A. The stock SD cards provided by DEFCOM are very poor quality and have a high failure rate. You can attempt to format the SD card by using the [official SD formatter found here](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/), and manually add folders named 'ROM' and 'SAVE' to the root of the SD card. If the badge can still not detect it, you will need to purchase a third party SD card and format it with a FAT# filesystem (not exFAT).  

## Guides

### General

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#awesome-dc32-badge)**

Various resources from around the community to help with troubleshooting, development, etc.

- [DC32 Badge Hacking Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jff1UbKaRGoHoAug1c0r6a4Y-MYruvgVORGG8c63sNQ) - The purpose of this document is to be a collective note gathering location for the DC32 Badge Challenge
- [Gameboy Interface to access Badge Features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COY5n0HhBcBq7ILwsKtOjV-_0-arNPkk_qBH9PI9fms) - GB hardware has a few unused IO regs in the IO reg range (0xFF00..0xFF7F). They are reused in this badge to expose extra functionality that GB-proper lacks. This document details how to use these features.
